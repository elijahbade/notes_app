#### **1. Product Overview**

The Note-Taking Application is a simple and efficient tool that allows users to create, update, delete, and manage personal notes. It is designed to be intuitive and fast, offering an accessible interface for users to store and organize their thoughts, ideas, and tasks in one place. The app is a full-stack web application with a backend powered by Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, and a frontend built using React and the Context API.

#### **2. Purpose and Scope**

- **Purpose**: The primary purpose of the Note-Taking Application is to offer users a digital platform to write, manage, and store their notes. Users can easily create new notes, edit existing ones, delete notes they no longer need, and access their notes from any device.
- **Scope**: The app will feature basic note-taking functionalities (CRUD operations) with user authentication and note categorization in future versions.

---

#### **3. Target Audience**

- **Individuals**: Users looking for a simple, no-frills note-taking solution.
- **Students and Professionals**: Those who need to organize their thoughts, tasks, or class notes.
- **Developers**: A learning tool for demonstrating the integration of MongoDB, Node.js, Express, React, and TypeScript.

---

#### **4. Features**

The MVP of the Note-Taking Application will focus on core note-taking functionalities, which include:

- **Create Notes**: Users can create new notes with a title and content.
- **Edit Notes**: Users can modify existing notes.
- **Delete Notes**: Users can delete notes they no longer need.
- **View All Notes**: Users can view a list of all their notes.
- **View Single Note**: Users can click on a specific note to view its content in detail.
  
**Future Features (Post-MVP):**
- **User Authentication**: Sign-up, login, and secure storage of notes per user.
- **Note Categories**: Allow users to categorize their notes (e.g., work, personal, study).
- **Search Functionality**: Enable searching through notes by title or content.
- **Rich Text Editor**: For more complex note-taking features (bold, italic, lists, etc.).

---

#### **5. Tech Stack**

##### **Backend:**
- **Node.js**: For building the server-side logic and REST API.
- **Express**: As the web framework for handling HTTP requests.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user data and notes.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and improved code maintainability.

##### **Frontend:**
- **React**: For building the user interface and rendering the application.
- **Context API**: For state management across the app without using external libraries like Redux.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and improved code maintainability.

---

#### **6. Architecture**

The application will follow a **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture:

- **Model (MongoDB with Mongoose)**: Stores user notes in a NoSQL database.
- **View (React)**: Presents the user interface, allowing users to interact with the app.
- **Controller (Express)**: Handles HTTP requests, communicates with the database, and returns the appropriate responses to the client.

---

#### **7. Functional Requirements**

1. **User Operations**:
   - Create a new note (title and content).
   - View a list of all notes.
   - View a single note in detail.
   - Update an existing note.
   - Delete an existing note.

2. **Backend API Endpoints**:
   - `POST /api/notes`: Create a new note.
   - `GET /api/notes`: Retrieve all notes.
   - `GET /api/notes/:id`: Retrieve a single note by its ID.
   - `PUT /api/notes/:id`: Update a note by its ID.
   - `DELETE /api/notes/:id`: Delete a note by its ID.

---

#### **8. Non-Functional Requirements**

- **Performance**: The application should load quickly, and the server should handle multiple requests efficiently.
- **Scalability**: The architecture should allow for adding new features (e.g., authentication) without major restructuring.
- **Security**: Future versions will include user authentication and secure handling of personal notes.
- **Maintainability**: The use of TypeScript ensures code is easy to maintain and scale.
- **Usability**: The app will have an intuitive UI, making it easy for users to create and manage notes.
- **Cross-Device Accessibility**: The frontend should be responsive, allowing users to access their notes on both desktop and mobile devices.

---

#### **9. User Stories**

1. **As a user**, I want to create new notes so that I can store important information.
2. **As a user**, I want to view all my notes so that I can quickly reference them.
3. **As a user**, I want to edit existing notes so that I can update my information.
4. **As a user**, I want to delete notes so that I can remove ones I no longer need.

#### **10. API Design**

- **Base URL**: `/api`

| Endpoint            | Method | Description               |
|---------------------|--------|---------------------------|
| `/api/notes`        | GET    | Fetch all notes            |
| `/api/notes`        | POST   | Create a new note          |
| `/api/notes/:id`    | GET    | Fetch a specific note      |
| `/api/notes/:id`    | PUT    | Update a note by ID        |
| `/api/notes/:id`    | DELETE | Delete a note by ID        |

---

#### **11. Database Schema**

- **Note Schema**:
  ```json
  {
    "title": "string",
    "content": "string",
    "createdAt": "Date",
  }
  ```

Fields:
- `title`: The title of the note (required).
- `content`: The content of the note (required).
- `createdAt`: Automatically generated timestamp.

#### **13. Risks and Assumptions**

- **Risk**: If the app scales, performance might degrade due to limited MongoDB queries.
  - **Mitigation**: Implement indexing and pagination in future releases.
- **Risk**: Security vulnerabilities may arise without authentication.
  - **Mitigation**: Implement user authentication in future iterations.
  
---

#### **14. Future Enhancements**

- **User Authentication**: Introduce sign-up/login functionality.
- **Note Categorization**: Allow users to group notes under specific categories (e.g., work, personal).
- **Note Sharing**: Users can share notes with others via email or links.
- **Collaborative Notes**: Enable multiple users to collaborate on a note.
